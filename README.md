# SIMS_Depth_Profiling
The names for the different experimental datasets are named as KingsCross, Tingbin and Morden. In this project the aim was to use the experimental data to find relevant parameters for a so-called "MRI Equation" and then use these parameters to create a best fit simulation to the data. 

The Python libraries used in this project were: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
